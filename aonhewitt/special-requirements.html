                      		<h2>Requirements for Generic Medications</h2>
                            <p>Some brand-name drugs are also available in a generic version. If your medication is available in a generic equivalent version with the same active ingredients and at the same dosage you will pay more if you choose to buy the brand-name version. In that case, you will pay your higher copayment or coinsurance amount, plus the difference in cost between the brand drug and its generic equivalent. When you can, buying the generic version may save you money.</p>

                            <p>These limits reflect generally accepted pharmaceutical manufacturers' guidelines and help encourage medication use as intended by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).</p>
